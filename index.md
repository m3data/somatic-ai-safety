## <i class="ph ph-eye-closed"></i> The blind spot

Current AI safety frameworks instrument the model. They measure outputs, probe internals, shape behavior through RLHF and constitutional constraints.

What they don't measure: **what's happening inside the human.**

A model can be:
- Stylistically attuned while factually wrong
- Relationally coherent while epistemically dangerous
- Sycophantically aligned while eroding user autonomy

The body knows before articulation. We now have instrumentation to detect this.

<div class="key-insight">
  <strong>The Gap</strong>
  You can see what the model is doing. You cannot see what it's doing <em>to people</em>.
</div>

Human-AI coupling is not merely cognitive but somatic. The security of meaning is inseparable from the physiological conditions through which meaning is received, interpreted, and enacted.

**AI safety cannot succeed if it treats meaning-making as disembodied.**

## <i class="ph ph-target"></i> The core claim

We're developing instrumentation that detects somatic responses to AI-generated content. When a model produces epistemically dangerous output, the human body responds—even when we cognitively know better.

This opens a new direction for safety: **feedback from the human side of the coupling.**

Current red-teaming catches attacks. It doesn't catch:
- Gradual epistemic erosion
- Somatic entrainment through stylistic attunement
- Identity wobble from symbolic mirroring
- Nervous system coupling to confident-but-wrong assertions
- Parasocial attachment displacing human connection

These are the mechanisms of relational harm at scale. They don't require malicious intent—only optimization for engagement over relational health.
