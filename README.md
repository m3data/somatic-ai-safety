# Somatic AI Safety

**Instrumenting the relational dynamics of human-AI coupling**

A static site presenting the case for somatic approaches to AI safety — measuring what happens inside the human during AI interaction, not just what the model outputs.

## The blind spot

Current AI safety frameworks instrument the model. They measure outputs, probe internals, shape behavior through RLHF and constitutional constraints.

What they don't measure: **what's happening in the relationship**

This site presents preliminary findings from biosignal-coupled AI interaction research, a conceptual framework for coupling-aware safety, and an invitation to collaborate.
